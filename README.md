# kaggle_atlas
In this competition, Kagglers will develop models capable of classifying mixed patterns of proteins in microscope images. 
The Human Protein Atlas will use these models to build a tool integrated with their smart-microscopy system to identify a 
protein's location(s) from a high-throughput image. The goal is to build a multi-label classifier to identify 28 possible 
protein structures in microscopy images.
